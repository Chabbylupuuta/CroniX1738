The name "Tonga Bull" has been echoing through the halls of CBU for longer than anyone can remember. But who is this culinary legend?
 None other than Martin Mwinga, the CEO extraordinaire of the legendary Tonga Bull restaurant.</p>

 <p class="attention-getter animate-on-load">   This reporter tracked him down in his natural 
 habitat (aka The Kitchen) to unravel the mystery behind the man and his meaty masterpiece.</p>

<h3 class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> From Bedroom Chef to Big-Time Boss</h3> 
<p class="attention-getter animate-on-load">Turns out, Martin's always had a fire in his belly (both literally and figuratively). Cooking isn't just a job for him, it's a symphony of 
sizzling spices and a ballet of bubbling pots. </p>
<p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> "Nshima with some fried or boiled fish? Child's play," he declares with a wink. "Lumanda?  </p>
<p class="attention-getter animate-on-load">Now that's where the magic happens." You can practically see the culinary passion radiating from his 
eyes like heat waves off a fresh batch of hot chips. </p>

                            "No hard feelings," says Martin, "they were just doing their job." But hey, even confiscated spatulas couldn't dampen his culinary spirit.

                             We're talking chicken and chips that would make Colonel Sanders weep tears of joy. But it's not just the grub that keeps them coming back.  </p>

                            <p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> They'll throw in another pack for good measure. "Leaving no customer behind," says Martin, "that's our motto."

                            <p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> Running a restaurant and acing your exams? Sounds like a recipe for disaster, right? Not for Martin. This guy's got time management skills that would make 
                            Patson Daka jealous. "Thirty minutes to an hour of studying, max," he reveals, "and boom, straight A's." He's like a culinary Usain Bolt,

                            <p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> Martin's ambitions are as big as his appetite. Kitwe's just the appetizer, folks. The main course? Taking over the entire country, one school cafeteria at a time. University of Zambia? Mulungushi University? Consider them conquered! And if that wasn't enough, he's even got his sights set on ECL mall, planning to open a shop there in a few moon cycles (because apparently, that's how Martin measures time). This reporter's mind is officially blown.

Ah, the Shawarma! Not just a humble wrap, but the holy grail of Tonga Bull's menu, as whispered by the man himself, Martin . 
 </p>
 <p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> This guy could polish off five of those bad boys in a single day, no sweat. "What can I say, I have a thing for juicy, spiced-up goodness," he confesses with a grin.</p>
 <p class="attention-getter animate-on-load">
But food fads aren't what really make Martin's stomach rumble. Oh no, his sales chart takes a nosedive steeper than a dropped Tonga Bul 4.  </p>

<p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> when the dreaded "BC dry spell" hits. But the moment those beautiful bursary cheques cash in, his restaurant becomes a scene straight out of a food coma mosh pit. "BC allowances? More like Tonga Bull fuel," he declares with a wink.</p>
<p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> 
This tech-savvy CEO ain't messing around with pen and paper. He's got an app on his phone that tracks sales like a cheetah on Red Bull. Every sizzling shawarma, every pack of goodness , all meticulously logged in the digital domain. Talk about being ahead of the curve!</p>
<p class="attention-getter animate-on-load"> Negativity? Martin takes it like a sprinkle of extra chilli on his Shawarma – spicy, but ultimately just adding to the flavor. He's in this game for the love, the passion, the pure, unadulterated joy of serving up culinary happiness. So next time you're in Kitwe, skip the boring burger chains and dive into the wild, wonderful world of Tonga Bull. Just do yourself a favor and bring your BC bucks – the Shawarma cravings hit hard, and Martin's not one to disappoint.
